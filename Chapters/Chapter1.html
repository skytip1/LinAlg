        Before we start talking about Matrices and Gaussian Elimination 
        you should be comfortable with the notion of vectors. 
        The books first Chapter skims Over the concept
        of vectors pretty fast but you should really take 
        a minute to know what a vecor represents.
        Below I have attatched some videos showing what a vector is.

            Now that you have a solid grasph on what vectors are we should
            get into the <i>algebra</i> of it.

            There are some simple opperations we can do with vectors. 
            For instance take the vector
            $$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{bmatrix}$$
            we can multiply any number to this vector and this gives the effect
            of "scailing" the vecor geometrically or in other words,
            $$c \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} cv_1 \\ cv_2 \\ cv_3 \end{bmatrix} = c\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{bmatrix}$$
            <p>
            Here is a more interactive way you can view scailing a vector.

                Now one vector is cool but what's even cooler is multiple vectors.
                This is where the beauty of Linear alegbra shines because we can represent 
                as many vectors as we want, even an infinite amount!

            <p>
                Now if you play around long enough you may notice some things. (I highly reccomend to play around and write down what you notice)
                You may notice that some of these can lines interesect at a point, while others (the green and blue)
                never intersect. And you may also notice that at some values none of the lines intersect. So what did I graph, what do these represent and why
                is intersection so important?
            </p>
            <p>
                The vectors or (linear equations) I graphed were the following
                $$-ax-by=-\frac{1}{2}$$ 
                $$ax-by=\frac{1}{9}$$
                $$2ax-3by=\frac{1}{6}$$
                $$ax\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} +by\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/9 \\ 1/6 \end{bmatrix}$$
                You may notice these are just equations of a line! This is where the name "Linear Algebra" comes from as 
                we are just manipulating a bunch of linear equations.
