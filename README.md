# LinAlg
This will be my notes for Linear Algebra. You are welcome to read and follow
if you are currently taking a linear algebra course. I am currently a student at Virgnia tech so most of my notes will come from class or from the book
"Linear Algebra and Its Applications" By Gilbert Strang. I also suggest watching 3blue1browns series on "The essence of Linear Algebra".
