        Before we start talking about Matrices and Gaussian Elimination 
        you should be comfortable with the notion of vectors. 
        The books first Chapter skims Over the concept
        of vectors pretty fast but you should really take 
        a minute to know what a vecor represents.
        Below I have attatched some videos showing what a vector is.

            Now that you have a solid grasph on what vectors are we should
            get into the <i>algebra</i> of it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" align="center">
            There are some simple opperations we can do with vectors. 
            For instance take the vector
            $$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{bmatrix}$$
            we can multiply any number to this vector and this gives the effect
            of "scailing" the vecor geometrically or in other words,
            $$c \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} cv_1 \\ cv_2 \\ cv_3 \end{bmatrix} = c\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{bmatrix}$$
            <p>
            Here is a more interactive way you can view scailing a vector.

            <p>
            Like wise we can also add vectors. This is pretty simple as we just add the numbers left to right on each column. This has the effect of putting the tip
            of the vector on the other vector.
            $$\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{bmatrix}$$
            $$\vec{u} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{bmatrix}$$
            $$\vec{v} + \vec{u} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1+u_1 \\ v_2 + u_2 \\ v_3 + u_3 \end{bmatrix} $$

            </p>
            <p>
                Now one vector is cool but what's even cooler is multiple vectors.
                This is where the beauty of Linear alegbra shines because we can represent 
                as many vectors as we want, even an infinite amount!

            <p>
                Now if you play around long enough you may notice some things. (I highly reccomend to play around and write down what you notice)
                You may notice that some of these can lines interesect at a point, while others (the green and blue)
                never intersect. And you may also notice that at some values none of the lines intersect. So what did I graph, what do these represent and why
                is intersection so important?
            </p>
            <p>
                The vectors or (linear equations) I graphed were the following
                $$-ax-by=-\frac{1}{2}$$ 
                $$ax-by=\frac{1}{9}$$
                $$2ax-3by=\frac{1}{6}$$
                $$ax\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} +by\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/9 \\ 1/6 \end{bmatrix}$$
                You may notice these are just equations of a line! This is where the name "Linear Algebra" comes from as 
                we are just manipulating a bunch of linear equations.
                In basic algebra we can solve an equation by looking where a line intersects. For example the equation
                $$x - 1 = 0 $$ we can look at the line $$y = x - 1$$ and find when it crosses the orgin. (since this is where y = 0). 
                </p>
                <div class="video" align="center">
                    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mjf1taqpty?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>
                Another way to think about this equation is "what numbers can I scale my vectors by so that the tip of there sum is equal to the resultant point."
                If you watched the 3Blue1Brown video you may know that he talks about scailing the basis vectors <strong><em>i</em></strong> and <strong><em>j</em></strong>  and we can represent any other vector by just scailing these two vectors.
                like-wise we can do the same for our linear equations.
                Going back to our example, 
                $$y = x-1 = 0$$
                we can rewrite as two seperate equations
                $$ y - x = -1$$
                $$ y = 0 $$
                and then we can write these as vectors.
                $$ x\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ 
                effectively what we've done is made our new basis vectors [-1, 0] and [1, 1] and we are looking at what <em><strong>Combination</strong></em>
                of these vectors will give us the vector [-1, 0]. We can then make the conclusion (geometrically, or algebraically if you notice we are just looking for the first basis vector) that our solution
                (x, y) must be equal to (1,0).
