            Ok now we're onto the big stuff, Matrices! Matrices have so many
            applications it would take forever to list them all and they will change your
            view on everything. Things like Artifical Intelligence, Quantum mechanics,
            the growth and decay of populations and so so so much more use matrices daily. Therefore, it's very important
            to make sure you have a solid grasp on what a matrix is as this is the backbone of everything we'll be doing in 
            linear algebra.

            As you saw in the video a matrix is basically a way to "Transform" our vector space to
            accomidate for our unit vectors.
            Going back to our previous example:
            $$ x\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
            I said that we made our new "basis" vectors the following $$\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
            Another way we can think of this is by representing these vectors as a matrix and the x y as a vector that takes any combination of x and y and "spans" our new space that warps to our unit vector placement. Or in other words:
            $$ \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x\\y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
            This following Animation animations provides a more geometric view of what is going on.

                    This visualization shows us warping the vector space to our new basis vectors or matrix. (the blue lines representing our new space)
                    and the black ones representing our old cartesian coordinates.
                    The main point is we used a matrix to represent our basis vectors.
                    
                    The equation 
                    $$ \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x\\y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
                    Asks us, "What vector [x, y] transforms under the given transformation such that it becomes the vector [-1,0]?"
                    and as we saw in the animation that is clearly the basis vector or <strong>i</strong> (the green arrow).
                    But what if we had a more complicated transformation? 
                    take 
                    $$\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 \\ 3 & 7 \end{bmatrix}$$
                    Again the following provides what this transformaion would look like.

                        And now imagine we want to find a certain vector [x, y] such that 
                        after the transformation lands on lets say [1, 2],
                        or in other words 
                        $$\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 \\ 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x\\y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$
                        There are infinite vectors in this space, how can we find the right one? Well we can recognize that this matrix must correspond to linear equations
                        right? I mean we went from a system of linear equations, to a combination of two vectors to a matrix so we should be able to go backwards right?
                        Yes you can! 
                        this linear equation simply corresponds to 
                        $$-3x + 2y$$
                        $$3x + 6y$$
                        Make sure you understand how we reached this conclusion.
