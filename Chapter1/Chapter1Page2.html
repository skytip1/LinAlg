            Ok now we're onto the big stuff, Matrices! Matrices have so many
            applications it would take forever to list them all and they will change your
            view on everything. Things like Artifical Intelligence, Quantum mechanics,
            the growth and decay of populations and so so so much more use matrices daily. Therefore, it's very important
            to make sure you have a solid grasp on what a matrix is as this is the backbone of everything we'll be doing in 
            linear algebra.
